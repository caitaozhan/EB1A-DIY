Giving Wegreened (WG) thousands of dollars and hope WG will take care of your EB1a application seems like the default choice. 
But doing-it-yourself (DIY) might actually be better. 
The reasons include but not limited to the following:

1. You have done your NIW application without EB1a a couple years ago.
The NIW experience and materials will reduce the need to ask for lawyers during the EB1a application.
2. Even if you have WG, you are still going to do most (three-forth?) of the real work (e.g. seeking for recommenders and drafting their letters). 
Also, you will waste a lot of time communicating with WG back and forth. 
3. You might get paired with bad lawyers who only knows to use templates. 
There is no gaurantee of the lawyer's quality. 
You may ended up nearly DIY even after paying thousands of dollars to WG.
4. You are a weak case (like only 200 citations) and need to dig into yourself in-depth. Only you can dig into yourself because only you know your story.
5. You are a DIY type of person and there are DIY packages on the Internet. DIY your EB1a will be a great accomplishment.
6. Leverage your PhD academic training. I have written so many papers, why not write another "long paper" to USCIS?
7. ChatGPT is amazingly powerful. There are even specialized GPTs just for green card application.
8. Last but not the least, you save some money. But please don't hesitate to spend money on premium processing if needed.
