# EB1a DIY Resource Center


**Abstract**: Giving Wegreened (WG) five thousand dollars (some others cost more) and hope WG will take care of your EB1a application seems like the default choice. 
But doing-it-yourself (DIY) might actually be better. 
The reasons include but not limited to the following:

1. You have done your NIW application without EB1a some years ago, probabily with some lawyers. 
The NIW experience will reduce the need to asking for lawyers during the EB1a application.
2. Even if you have WG, you are still going to do around (at least?) two-third of the real work (e.g. seeking for recommenders and drafting their letters). 
Also, you will waste a lot of time (wait reply for days) communicating with WG. 
3. You might get paired with bad lawyers who only knows to use templates. 
The lawyer you are paired with is randomly chosen and there is no gaurantee of the lawyer's quality. 
I have heard stories from friends complaining about awful lawyers who only make things worse and ended up nearly DIY even after paying thousands of dollars to WG.
4. You are a weak case (like only 200 citations) and need to dig into yourself in-depth. Only you can dig into yourself because only you know your story.
5. You are a DIY type of person. DIY your EB1a will be a great accomplishment.
6. Leverage your PhD academic training. I have written so many papers, why not write another "long paper" to USCIS?
7. ChatGPT is amazingly powerful and is only getting better! There are even specialized GPTs just for green card application.
8. Last but not the least, saving money is good. Save money on WG and spend it on premiem processing.
